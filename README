FXPF
====

A python wrapper for the Fixed-Point Formats (FXPF) library.

For a LTI IIR filter in state-space representation H={A,B,C,D}, bound on input values
u and wordlegths for state- and output-variable representation the library, if possible,
determines Fixed-Point Formats for its state- and output-variables such that no overflow
occurs.
